# rootstock_rna_move

Test whether RNA has moved across the graft union.

Plan:
Identify snps in Gala
Identify snps in M27 and M116 
Identify snps unique between Gala:M27 and Gala:M116
Align RNAQseq reads to apple genome
Count SNPs in RNAseq 

The allele-seq pipeline may provide a convenient method for doing the majority of this work.
